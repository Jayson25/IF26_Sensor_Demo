## What is this project

It is a demo that will be shown during a school presentation about Sensors and Embedded application at the "Universit√© de Technologie de Troyes" for the course IF26

The code is in Java with android component, therefore you must use Android Studio in order to edit and compile the code. 

In order to fetch the project directly from the IDE, please follow the tutorial in the following link: http://wii.logdown.com/posts/2013/11/15/android-studio-git-tutorial

## Can I improve the demo

Of course, you can ticket the repo in case you want to add an improvement. Soon, I might add a community branch for you to have fun in it :)

## Can I copy the code and commercialize it?

Yes, but you need to modify add functionnalities and mention the author in your project. No royalty will be asked.

## When will you do an iOS version?

Don't know, I can do an iOS equivalent but will I? :p
